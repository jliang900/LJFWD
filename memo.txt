[MySQL]

After downloading and unzipping, original files are placed under
/usr/local/mysql-5.6.24-osx10.8-x86_64/, and following instructions in
/usr/local/mysql-5.6.24-osx10.8-x86_64/INSTALL-BINARY, a symbolic link is
created at /usr/local/mysql.

It is suggested to create group mysql and user mysql. However on Mac OS there is
not groupadd nor useradd commands as in other linux. Instead 'dscl' is the way
to go, and it is quite complicated. I did not follow it. I simply used chown and
as a result it seemed to create _mysql group and _mysql user.

After running /usr/local/mysql/scripts/mysql_install_db, mysql sets up its db.
See /usr/local/mysql/install.20150505.log for more details.

*******************
[Tomcat]

The original distribution file is downloaded at
/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Workspace/Download/DEV/apache-tomcat-8.0.21.tar.gz.

The distribution is then unzipped to /usr/local/apache-tomcat-8.0.21/ and a
symbolic link is created as /usr/local/tomcat/.

Start tomcat:
$/usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
Stop tomcat:
$/usr/local/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh

[MySQL [Abandoned connection cleanup thread] in Tomcat]

MySQL connector/J 5.1.26
MySQL 5.6.24
Tomcat 8.0.21

When I test the "booksWeb" project ("Learn Java for Web Development"), tomcat
reports in catalina.log a WARNING that "The web applicaation [booksWeb] appears
to have started a thread named [Abandoned connection cleanup thread] but has
failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak."

After some study online, it seems that this thread is started by MySQL in a
static initiation, and may be responsible for clean up mysql connections. How-
ever, somehow this thread is not closed properly, or at least Tomcat thinks so.

According to "http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?3,585600,585600", MySQL con/J
5.1.25 has fixed it. It states that:

* Tomcat would fail to stop abandoned connection cleanup
    threads. The fix for Bug#65909 introduced the ability to stop
    daemon threads started by the Connector/J driver but it also
    cleared references from daemon threads to the parent
    classloader. When the clearReferencesStopThreads property is
    set to "true" in context.xml, Tomcat analyzes classloaders to
    detect and stop lost threads. This fix ensures that abandoned
    connection cleanup threads retain a reference to the parent
    classloader. (Bug #68556, Bug #16443387)
    
Nevertheless, I still observe the WARNING.

Solutions on the web has two main flavors, as this thread reveals:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11872316/tomcat-guice-jdbc-memory-leak.
One school proposes to have a context listener or something similar explicitly
shut down this thread. There are various ways to do it. The other school, which
I followed and preferred, simply alters the server.xml for Tomcat, directing its
JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener to handle com.mysql.jdbc.NonRegisteringDriver:

  <Listener className="org.apache.catalina.core.JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener"   
        classesToInitialize="com.mysql.jdbc.NonRegisteringDriver"/>

This directive removed the WARNING without adding any code in JSP or web.xml.

However, this requires tomcat to load mysql jdbc lib before loading any web
applications, and therefore it needs the mysql jdbc jar file in tomcat lib/
folder.

Some brief online study suggests the following:
1. some people prefer putting mysql jdbc jar file in each web app's lib/,
so that they could use different versions if needed;
2. others want a connection polled JNDI datassource to improve performance,
so they put it in tomcat lib/;
3. it is said the jar in WEB-INF/lib/ would override the one in tomcat/lib/
for that particular web app;

(But, if the two jar files are of different version, I am not sure if the
NonRegisteringDriver class in the jar that tomcat has can work with the  
[Abandoned connection cleanup thread] started by the jar of the web app.

After all, since I expect to have a pooled JNDI datasource in the future,
I decided to put the jar in tomcat/lib/. This works fine with the samples in
the early chapters in LJWD. These samples directly use DriverManager#getConnection()
method, and all it asks is the mysql jdbc jar in class path.

*******************
[Deploy a web application in Tomcat]

1. Generate WAR file. E.g., export it from within eclipse.
2. Copy the WAR file to /usr/local/tomcat/webapp/. Restart Tomcat.
3. Or, better yet, from Tomcat Manager (web GUI) deploy the WAR file.
Either way, Tomcat would copy the WAR to the webapp/ folder, and for abc.war it
would unzip it to abc/ folder, which holds contents like META-INF/, WEB-INF/,
jsp/, css/, js/, etc.

*******************
[Include supporting jar libraries]

For example, to have mysql support, Tomcat need mysql-connector-{version}.jar.
One way is to have it in $CATALINA_HOME/lib. This would make it visible to all
applications in Tomcat. Not so good if different applications need different
versions of it. The better way is to have it deployed into $CATALINA_HOME/
webapps/$YOUR_APP/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/ for each application that need it. If
it is placed in the $YOUR_ECLIPSE_PROJ_ROOT/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/, eclipse
would pack it within the war file. When Tomcat deploy that war file, the jar
is unpacked into $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/$YOUR_APP/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/.

Similarly, to have JSTL support, place jstl-{ver}.jar and standard-{ver}.jar
in .../WEB-INF/lib/ as well. Without them, Tomcat would report that JVM cannot
find/create some class(es) like org.apache.jsp.book_jsp, where book.jsp has
some references to jstl like:

<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions" prefix="fn"%>

If Maven is used to manage the dependencies, I don't need to manually place jar
files in the .../lib/ folder. Instead, I would list the supporting libraries in
my POM file and Maven would automatically pull them and pack them into my war.

One interesting and important minute is that, at first I placed two symlinks of
jstl-{ver}.jar and standard-{ver}.jar in .../WEB-INF/lib/, and that was all
right with compiling, packaging and execution. However, that left eclipse in
confusion and it showed me red crosses with all Expression Language (EL) state-
ments. For example:

<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions" prefix="fn"%>
...
            <td>${fn:escapeXml("<%=author.getName()%>")}</td>
...

Eclipse complained that "the function 'fn:escapeXml' is undefined." After I
replaced the symlinks with the real jar files, this error message disappeared.

*******************
[JSP]

- JSP files should be placed under WEB-INF/{optional_subfolder/}.
- If a servlet-mapping is defined to map a url-pattern to a servlet, and this
servlet then creates a RequestDispatcher with a JSP file as the url, then
forward() the request to this url, then this JSP would be processed by the web
container (e.g., tomcat).
- Or, a browser could point directly to an url such as http://.../xxx.jsp, and
typically for a asp residing in WebContent/somepath/x.jsp, it could be referenced
as http://host.name/webappname/somepath/x.jsp.
- Thus, it is a question how to prevent user from pointing a browser directly to
a jsp which should be invisible.

*******************
[Maven]

Maven 3.0.3 comes with my Mac OS 10.8.2. Eclipse Luna comes with Maven plugin.

At first when I tried to use eclipse to create a maven project of
maven-archetype-webapp type, it failed with the following error:

Could not resolve archetype org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-webapp:RELEASE from any of the configured repositories.
Could not resolve artifact org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-webapp:pom:RELEASE
Failed to resolve version for org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-webapp:pom:RELEASE: Could not find metadata org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-webapp/maven-metadata.xml in local (/Users/jliang/.m2/repository)
Failed to resolve version for org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-webapp:pom:RELEASE: Could not find metadata org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-webapp/maven-metadata.xml in local (/Users/jliang/.m2/repository)

Online search pointed to several directions, including
* downloading the maven-archetype-webapp-{ver}.jar and register it with maven so
that maven has it in the local repository.
* creating the correct proxy settings in maven user setting file (typically
~/.m2/setting.xml).
* http://www.tuicool.com/articles/36FFBv, adding a mirror site.

I didn't try the first approach since it de-automated the process. I fixed the
proxy settings but it doesn't solve the problem. The third one worked:

<mirrors>
	<mirror>
		<id>ibiblio.org</id>
		<name>ibiblio Mirror of http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</name>
		<url>http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2</url>
		<mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
	</mirror>
</mirrors>

*******************
[Git, Eclipse, and Maven]

What files should be checked into git? Some people choose to include eclipse
(or other IDE alike) specific files such as .classpath, .project, .settings/*.pref, so that once checked out it is *IMMEDIATELY* usable. Some choose not to
include them so that the project is IDE independent. With the help of maven,
a reasonable solution is to check in pom.xml and have git ignore other IDE files
with the help of .gitignore. Once checked out, maven could happily create the
eclipse files for you ($>mvm eclipse:eclipse).

*******************
[Maven template based projects]

Maven can create project skeletons based on many prebuilt templates, such as
maven-archetype-webapp. Note, however, that in my trial, the project is set to
be compatible with java1.5. I have jre/jdk 1.8 installed, so eclipse complains
that some incompatibility. I changed the java 1.5 to java 1.8 in the project facet (project property) and that is gone.
